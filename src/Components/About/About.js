                <h5>I find enjoyment in making code work. It gives me a sense of pride knowing "I did that. I made that happen." It's fun creating a working website out of nothing.</h5>
                <h5>I dabbled in basic HTML in high school and really enjoyed it. When I heard about DevMountain I thought it would be a good opportunity to really explore web development and create websites of my own.</h5>
                <h5>I am now excited to start a new career as a developer and learn all I can about web developing.</h5>
